      question: "What is Ownership in Rust?",
      answer:
        "Ownership is a set of rules that governs how a Rust program manages memory. Every value in Rust has a variable thatâ€™s called its owner, and there can only be one owner at a time. When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.",
      topic: "Rust",
      code: `
  fn main() {
      let s1 = String::from("hello");
      let s2 = s1; // s1 is moved to s2
      // println!("{}", s1); // This would cause a compile error because s1 is no longer valid

      question: "How does Borrowing work in Rust?",
      answer:
        "Borrowing allows you to create references to a value without taking ownership of it. References can be either mutable or immutable, but you cannot have mutable references while immutable ones exist. This ensures safety and prevents data races.",
      topic: "Rust",

      question: "What are Lifetimes in Rust?",
      answer:
        "Lifetimes are a way of expressing the scope for which a reference is valid. They are used to prevent dangling references and ensure that references are always valid. Rust uses lifetime annotations to help the compiler understand how long references should be valid.",
      topic: "Rust",

      let r;

      answer:
        "Traits are a way to define shared behavior in Rust. They are similar to interfaces in other languages. A trait defines methods that can be implemented by types, and a type can implement multiple traits. Traits enable polymorphism in Rust.",

      answer:
        "Closures are anonymous functions that can capture the environment in which they are defined. They are used for functional programming in Rust, allowing functions to be treated as first-class citizens. Closures can capture variables from their enclosing scope, making them powerful and flexible.",
