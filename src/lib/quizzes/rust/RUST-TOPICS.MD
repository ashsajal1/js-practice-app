Here's a breakdown of core concepts in Rust, organized for learning:

**1. Ownership and Borrowing**

* **Ownership:** A fundamental concept in Rust. Each value in Rust has a single owner. When the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped (cleaned up).
* **Borrowing:**  Allows you to access data owned by another variable without taking ownership. Borrows have rules to prevent data corruption (e.g., multiple mutable borrows at the same time).
* **References:**  Pointers that allow you to access data owned by other variables. They are immutable by default, but you can create mutable references.

**2. Data Types**

* **Scalar Types:**  Represent single values:
    * **Integers:** `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128`, `isize` (signed), `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`, `usize` (unsigned)
    * **Floating-Point:** `f32`, `f64`
    * **Booleans:** `bool` (true or false)
    * **Characters:** `char` (Unicode characters)
* **Compound Types:**  Combine multiple values:
    * **Tuples:** Fixed-size collections of different data types.
    * **Arrays:** Fixed-size collections of the same data type.
    * **Slices:**  Dynamically sized views into arrays.
    * **Strings:**  Immutable sequences of characters.
    * **Structs:**  Custom data structures that group related data together.
    * **Enums:**  Allow you to define a type that can have a fixed set of values.

**3. Control Flow**

* **`if` Statements:**  Execute code blocks conditionally based on a boolean expression.
* **`else` and `else if`:**  Provide alternative code blocks to execute if the `if` condition is false.
* **`match` Statements:**  Pattern matching, allowing you to compare a value against multiple patterns and execute different code blocks based on the match.
* **Loops:**
    * **`loop`:**  Executes a block of code repeatedly.
    * **`while`:**  Executes a block of code as long as a condition is true.
    * **`for`:**  Iterates over a sequence of values.
    * **`for in`:**  Iterates over the elements of an array or slice.

**4. Functions**

* **Defining Functions:** Use the `fn` keyword to define functions.
* **Parameters and Arguments:** Functions can take input parameters and return values.
* **Return Values:**  Functions can return a single value or a tuple of values.
* **Methods:**  Functions associated with a specific data type (structs, enums).

**5. Modules and Crates**

* **Modules:**  Organize your code into logical units.
* **Crates:**  The building blocks of Rust projects. They can contain multiple modules.
* **`use` Keyword:**  Brings items from other modules into scope.
* **`extern crate` (deprecated):**  Used to bring external crates into scope.

**6. Error Handling**

* **`Result` Type:** Represents either a successful value or an error.
* **`Option` Type:** Represents either a value or the absence of a value.
* **`unwrap()`:**  Retrieves the value from a `Result` or `Option`, panicking if the value is not present.
* **`expect()`:**  Similar to `unwrap()`, but allows you to provide a custom error message.
* **`match` for Error Handling:**  Use `match` to handle different error cases.

**7. Traits**

* **Traits:**  Define shared behavior for different types.
* **Implementing Traits:**  Implement traits for your custom types to provide the specified behavior.
* **Generic Functions:**  Functions that can work with different types by using traits.

**8. Structs and Enums**

* **Structs:**  Custom data structures that group related data together.
* **Enums:**  Allow you to define a type that can have a fixed set of values.
* **Pattern Matching with Enums:**  Use `match` to handle different enum variants.

**9. Lifetime Annotations**

* **Lifetimes:**  Used to specify the duration of a reference's validity.
* **Lifetime Elision:**  Rust can often infer lifetimes automatically, but you may need to provide explicit annotations in some cases.

**10. Macros**

* **Macros:**  Code that generates other code.
* **Declarative Macros:**  Define custom syntax.
* **Procedural Macros:**  More powerful macros that can manipulate the Rust compiler's AST.

**11. Asynchronous Programming**

* **`async` and `await`:**  Enable asynchronous programming, allowing you to write non-blocking code.
* **Futures:**  Represent the eventual result of an asynchronous operation.
* **`tokio`:**  A popular asynchronous runtime for Rust.

**12. Memory Management**

* **Stack and Heap:** Rust manages memory automatically, using the stack for local variables and the heap for dynamically allocated data.
* **Automatic Memory Management:**  Rust's ownership and borrowing system ensures that memory is freed when it's no longer needed, preventing memory leaks.

**13. Cargo**

* **Cargo:**  Rust's build system and package manager.
* **`Cargo.toml`:**  A file that defines your project's dependencies and metadata.
* **`Cargo.lock`:**  A file that locks down the versions of your dependencies.

**14. Standard Library**

* **`std`:**  Rust's standard library, providing a wide range of utilities and data structures.
* **`io`:**  Input/output operations.
* **`fs`:**  File system operations.
* **`collections`:**  Data structures like vectors, hash maps, and sets.
* **`str`:**  String manipulation.

**15. Testing**

* **Unit Tests:**  Test individual functions or modules.
* **Integration Tests:**  Test how different parts of your code interact.
* **`#[test]` Attribute:**  Mark functions as unit tests.
* **`cargo test`:**  Run tests using Cargo.

**16. Documentation**

* **`#[doc]` Attribute:**  Add documentation comments to your code.
* **`cargo doc`:**  Generate documentation for your project.

**17. Safety**

* **Memory Safety:**  Rust prevents memory leaks and dangling pointers.
* **Data Race Prevention:**  Rust's ownership system prevents multiple threads from accessing the same data concurrently without proper synchronization.
